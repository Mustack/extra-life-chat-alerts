# extra-life-chat-alerts

This is a quick hack I put together to add donation alerts in Twitch chat when someone donated to my extra-life campaign. I couldn't find a tool to do this out of the box since most tools are focused on on-screen notifications.

A lot of stuff is hard-coded, like the channel name, but you can change those values to suit your own purposes.

The boilerplate I started with is a simple IRC bot that listens for someone to send a chat message of "!dice" and responds with a dice roll. I didn't bother removing that so this bot also gives you the !dice command.

## Need Help?
If you are hosting an extra-life campaign on Twitch and want to use this but don't know how to change this for your own channel, please open an Issue on this project or email me. I would be happy to spend a bit of time getting you set up with this for your channel.
